# movie-search-simple-react
A simple movie search application built using React. This project allows users to search for movies by title and view basic information about them, leveraging a public movie API. It demonstrates fundamental React concepts including component-based architecture, state management with React Hooks (useState, useEffect), and asynchronous data fetching.


# Movie Search (Simple React)

A simple movie search application built with **React** and **Vite**.  
This project allows users to search for movies by title and view essential information, including the poster, rating, description, release date, and title. It demonstrates core React concepts such as component-based architecture, state management using Hooks, and asynchronous data fetching from a public API.

## Features
- Search for movies by title  
- Display movie posters and key details  
- Show movie ratings, release dates, and descriptions  
- Built using functional React components and Hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`)  
- Responsive and clean user interface  

---

## Built With
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) – Development environment and build tool  
- [React](https://react.dev/) – Library for building user interfaces  
- [The Movie Database (TMDB) API](https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api) – Source of movie data  

---

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/dbrooks11/movie-search-simple-react.git

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**
    cd movie-search-simple-react


3. **Install dependencies:**
    npm install


4. **Run the development server:**
    npm run dev


## API Usage

This project uses the TMDB public API to retrieve movie data.
The API key is not included in the repository to prevent exposure.
To use your own TMDB API key:

1. Create an account on The Movie Database (https://www.themoviedb.org/)

2. Generate an API key from your TMDB account settings.

3. Create a .env file in the project root and add your key as follows:

VITE_TMDB_API_KEY=your_api_key_here


## Learning Objectives

- This project was developed to reinforce the following React and web development concepts:

- Component-based application design

- State management using React Hooks

- Fetching and displaying API data asynchronously

- Organizing and structuring React projects for scalability

- Creating responsive and accessible user interfaces
